# DevOps Show and Tell 

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to migrate the NUS Money app 1.0 from localhost environment to cloud based.

Netlify will be hosting the static web assets. In addition, it will provide serverless functions that act as APIs for the frontend client to obtain data from the source. Serverless function FaaS model is more cost effective and scalable. Cloud based Fauna database will replace the local MySQL. It has native integration suport with Netlify.
